## ReaMIDI

(see [Wiki](https://github.com/Lazzle/ReaMIDI/wiki) for more detailed instructions/help/docs)

These scripts work in Reaper 5 only.  To use them you need to:

* Download the zip over on the right of the screen
* Open the zip file and drag n drop the 'ReaMIDI-master' folder found inside into the Scripts folder of your REAPER resource folder
* Rename the 'ReaMIDI-master' folder to just 'ReaMIDI'

You can easily get to your REAPER resource folder by running the action...

#####Show REAPER resource path in explorer

...from within REAPER.  The path should now end in REAPER\Scripts\ReaMIDI.
If it's not exactly that the scripts will not work.

You can run most of them either in the arrange view, where they will usually work
on the active take of selected items, or in the MIDI editor.

In the MIDI editor the note related ones should work on selected notes, or all 
notes if none are selected.  Selection persists in the arrange view so you can select
notes in the ME and run Create Item from Selected Notes in the arrange for example.
