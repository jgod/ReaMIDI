## ReaMIDI

These scripts work in Reaper 5 only.  To use them you must put the ReaMIDI folder
the Scripts folder of your REAPER resource path, which you can easily get to by
running the action...

#####Show REAPER resource path in explorer

...from within the program.  Then just drop the ReaMIDI folder in there so that
the path ends in REAPER\Scripts\ReaMIDI.  If it's not exactly there the scripts 
will not work.

You can run most of them either in the arrange view, where they will usually work
on the active take of selected items, or in the MIDI editor.

In the MIDI editor the note related ones will should work on selected notes, or all 
notes if none are selected.  Selection persists in the arrange view so you can select
notes in the ME and run Create Item from Selected Notes in the arrange for example.
